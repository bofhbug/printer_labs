         This file describes how to define custom paper sets used  by
	the SPLOT program for individual plotter types.

         A paper set is a group of maximum 30 paper sizes from  which
	you can select default paper size (plotter hard-clip  limits)
	in  the  Paper  Size  dialog.  The  number  30  has origin in
	combination of  3   possible norms  (ANSI,ISO,Architectural),
	5  possible  formats  (A,B,C,D,E  for  ANSI  or  ARCH   norm;
	A4,A3,A2,A1,A0 for ISO norm) and 2 possible modifiers  (named
	NORMAL and EXPAND). You must define at least one valid  paper
	size to create a valid paper set.

         The SPLOT program  searches for user  defined paper sets  in
	the PAPERS.INI file which conforms to Windows  initialization
	file format. Each found section  defines a new paper set  (if
	it is valid) except the [PAPERS] section which defines  paper
	set  assignments  to  individual  plotter  types.   The SPLOT
	program first searches for the PAPERS.INI file in the startup
	directory, then in the program directory.

         Because of the present version of the SPLOT program has  not
	a paper set  edit dialog built  in, you should  edit directly
	the PAPERS.INI file to  create, redefine or delete  any paper
	set. The paper set assignment to the current plotter type can
	be done in the Paper Size dialog.

         The general syntax for defining a paper set is:

        [PAPER_SET_NAME]
        keyword1 = ...
        keyword2 = ...
        .
        .
        .

	 The valid paper  size is defined  by its X  and Y dimensions
	expressed  in  plotter  units  and  is  identical  to plotter
	hard-clip limits  (see your  HP-GL or  HP-GL/2 reference  for
	description  of  plotter  hard-clip  limits). The one plotter
	unit is equal to 0.025 mm. The larger dimension of the  paper
	size always represents the  X axis in non-rotated  state (see
	your  HP-GL  or  HP-GL/2  reference  for  description  of  RO
	instruction). These  plotter types  do not  accept a  plotter
	size dimension  larger than  32767 plotter  units:   HP7470A,
	HP7475A, HP7440A,  HP DraftPro  7570A and  Roland DXY.   Note
	that you can  define only the  dimensions of the  paper size.
	The origin  of plotter  coordinates is  determined by plotter
	type. These  plotter types  have origin  always in lower-left
	corner of  the hard-clip  limits:   HP-GL/2 plotter, HP7470A,
	HP7475A,  HP7440A  and  HP7550A.  These  plotter  types  have
	normally origin in center  of the hard-clip limits,  although
	the SPLOT program enables  you set origin also  in lower-left
	corner: HP DraftPro, HP DraftMaster, Roland GRX 300/400.

	Syntax for paper size definition:
	 PKEYWORD = Xdimension x Ydimension
	   or
	 PKEYWORD = Xdimension,Ydimension
	where PKEYWORD identifies the defined paper size (see the
	list bellow).

	Examples:
         ANSI_A=10170 x 7840
         ISO_A4=2*4820 x 2*3560
         ISO_A4E=2*5260 x 2*4000

        Note  that  you  can  use  simple multiplication in dimension
        definition. It  facilitates you  to enter  dimensions if your
        plotter  has  origin  of  plotter  coordinates  in  center of
	hard-clip limits  and you  know hard-clip  limits coordinates
	(e.g. -4820,-3560, 4820,3560).

 	 Along  with  a  paper  size  you  can define default scaling
	points for this  paper size. The  scaling points are  used by
	the SC (scale) instruction to establish user-unit scaling and
	can be  redefined by  the IP  instruction (see  your HP-GL or
	HP-GL/2  reference  for  details).  You  can  define  default
	scaling points as relative or absolute. If you do not  define
	any  default  scaling  points  for  a paper size, the default
	scaling  points  are  always  identical  to  hard-clip  limit
	corners.

	 The  relative  scaling  points  are determined relatively to
	lower-left  and  upper-right  corners  of  paper size and are
	expressed in plotter units. When you define relative  scaling
	points,  they  are  defined  for  entire  paper  set  and all
	absolute scaling  points definitions  in this  paper set  are
	ignored.  These  plotter  types  use  only  relative  scaling
	points:  HP DraftPro, HP DraftMaster, Roland GRX 300/400  and
	HP-GL/2 plotter. For the HP-GL/2 plotter the default  scaling
	points are always identical  to hard-clip limit corners  (they
	are zero relative), so it ignores all default scaling  points
	definitions.

	Syntax for relative scaling points definition:
	 IP_REL = P1X_REL,P1Y_REL,P2X_REL,P2Y_REL
	Default scaling points are computed as follows:
	 P1X_DEF=MIN_PLT_X+P1X_REL
	 P1Y_DEF=MIN_PLT_Y+P1Y_REL
	 P2X_DEF=MAX_PLT_X-P2X_REL
	 P2Y_DEF=MAX_PLT_Y-P2Y_REL

	Example:
	 IP_REL = 600,600,600,600
	 ; default for HP DraftMaster, DraftPro and Roland GRX


         The  absolute  scaling  points  are  determined  in absolute
	plotter  coordinates  and  can  be  defined  separately   for
	non-rotated and  rotated states  (see your  HP-GL or  HP-GL/2
	reference for description of RO instruction). If the  rotated
	scaling points are not  separately defined, they are  created
	by rotation of non-rotated scaling points.  Note that if  you
	define relative scaling points,  they are defined for  entire
	paper set and all absolute scaling points definitions in this
	paper set are ignored. Also note that these plotter types use
	only relative scaling points and ignore all absolute  scaling
	points definitions: HP  DraftPro, HP DraftMaster,  Roland GRX
	300/400 and HP-GL/2 plotter.

        Syntax for absolute scaling points definition:
	 IP_PKEYWORD = P1X_ABS,P1Y_ABS,P2X_ABS,P2Y_ABS
	   for non-rotated absolute scaling points
	 IPR_PKEYWORD = P1RX_ABS,P1RY_ABS,P2RX_ABS,P2RY_ABS
	   for rotated absolute scaling points
	where PKEYWORD identifies the corresponding paper size (see
	the list above) and P1X(R)_ABS < P2X(R)_ABS and
	P1Y(R)_ABS < P2Y(R)_ABS.

        Examples:
	 IP_ISO_A4=603,521,10603,7721
	  ; non-rotated absolute scaling points for ISO A4 NORMAL
	    paper size
	 IPR_ISO_A4=0,610,7200,10610
	  ; rotated absolute scaling points for ISO A4 NORMAL paper
	    size
