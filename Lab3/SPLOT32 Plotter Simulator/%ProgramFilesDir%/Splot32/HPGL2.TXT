        This file contains  some reference information  about HP-GL/2
        support provided by the SPLOT program.

        The 32-bit version of the SPLOT  program supports HP-GL/2 pen
        plotters and HP-GL/2 raster devices.

        The implemented support of the HP-GL/2 language is based on
        "The HP-GL/2 and HP RTL Reference Guide - A Handbook for 
        Program Developers", Hewlett Packard 2nd edition,
        September 1996.


        1) Important parameters:
        ========================
        Number of pens: user defined up to 256.
        For pen plotters the number of pens is physical number of
        pens in carousel.
        For pen plotters the following modulo function is used for
        pen numbers greater than number of pens (np):
                        pn = ( (pn-1) mod np ) + 1
        For raster devices the number of pens is maximum number of
        logical pens, the actual number of logical pens is defined
        by NP instruction and its default value is 8 for color
        raster devices and 2 for monochrome raster devices. However
        only color raster devices are supported now.
        For raster devices the following modulo function is used for
        pen numbers greater or equal to current number of pens (np):
                        pn = ( (pn-1) mod (np-1) ) + 1
        Note that for raster devices the pens are numbered from zero
        and pen number 0 is valid pen. However it is usually white
        colored and all white pens are not used when the transparency
        mode is on (default state) (see TR instruction).
        For pen plotters the pen number 0 causes storing of a current
        pen to carousel and no pen is used.

        Paper size: user definable (see the PAPERS.TXT file)
                    or defined by the PS instruction

        Plotter unit: 0.025 mm

        Maximal number of digits in decimal fraction to be read: 10

        Supported character fonts (typefaces):
         The present version of the HP-GL/2 interpreter supports only
        the  stick  fonts  (characters  are  drawn  as  a  series  of
        vectors). The scalable outline fonts or bitmap fonts are  not
        supported. Note that not all HP-GL/2 devices support  outline
        or bitmap fonts, but all HP-GL/2 devices support stick fonts.
         From stick fonts only fixed-vector font (typeface number 48)
        and drafting  font (typeface  number 49)  are supported.  The
        variable spacing fonts are not supported yet. Also the  fixed
        arc font is not supported yet. Note that the drafting font is
        for use  with the  HP Drafting  character set  (character set
        number 563).

        Supported character sets:
         The present version of the HP-GL/2 interpreter supports only
        these character sets:

         Character |                                     |

        3) Alphabetical list of HP-GL/2 instructions that are
           partially supported by the SPLOT program (they may
           be fully supported in next SPLOT versions):
        ======================================================
         AD  - The Alternate Font Definition Instruction
               Only the character set attribute is supported.
               All other attributes are ignored.
               The character size (pitch and height attributes)
               should be specified by the SI or SR instruction.
               The stroke weight attribute is always considered
               to be 9999 (the characters are drawn in the current
               pen width).
               The typeface is always considered to be 48 (stick
               font) except for character set number 563 (HP-GL
               Drafting).
         BP  - The Begin Plot Instruction
               Only the initialization (IN) part is supported.
         FT  - The Fill Type Instruction
               There are supported fill types 1,2,3,4 and 10.
               The shading for fill type 10 is simulated by a pen color
               lightening so to obtain well looking results it is strongly
               recommended to use an high-color or true-color video mode.
               The support of fill type 10 can be switched ON or OFF in SPLOT.
               When switched OFF the fill type 10 is treated as fill type 1.
               The fill type 11 (user-defined raster fill) is treated as
               fill type 1 (i.e. by the same way as if none RF instruction
               was previously used).
         MC  - The Merge Control Instruction
               The opcode parameter is converted to an appropriate binary
               raster operation because the Windows GDI does not support
               ternary raster operations for pen and raster fill output.
               The conversion to a binary raster operation is done by
               considering the Texture operand always as zero.
               Note that there can be up to three operands in ternary reaster
               operations - Source (pens, fills), Destination (already drawn
               output) and Texture (any user selected pattern).
               The support of MC instruction can be switched ON or OFF in SPLOT.
               Also note that MC support can be separately controlled for printing.
         SD  - The Standard Font Definition Instruction
               See the AD instruction.
         SV  - The Screened Vectors Instruction
               Only screen type 1 (shaded fill) is supported. The shading
               is simulated by a pen color lightening so to obtain well
               looking results it is strongly recommended to use an high-color
               or true-color video mode.
               The screen type 2 (user-defined raster fill) is still ignored.
               The support of SV instruction can be switched ON or OFF in SPLOT.
         TD  - The Transparent Data Instruction
               When transparent data mode is enabled, SPLOT 
               prints all control characters as spaces.


        4) Alphabetical list of HP-GL/2 instructions that are not
