 This  file  contains   important  licensing, registration and
 evaluation information about the SPLOT for Windows program.

 SPLOT  is  distributed  as  "Shareware"  or  "User  Supported
 Software" and is fully copyrighted.  If you will register the
 program you will receive these benefits:

   1) The latest version of SPLOT.
   2) A technical  reference  in Windows help format  which
      describes all plotter instructions supported by SPLOT
      (from ver.3.1 the printed manuals are not supplied so
      there are no more shipping charges).
   3) An end to the nag screens and opening banners.
   4) Deep discounts on the next major versions.
   5) The warming feeling.

 There are three types of license:
   1) A single user license permits a single user to use SPLOT
      only on a single computer at a time.
   2) A multi user license permits to simultaneously use  more
      SPLOT copies on  more computers at  a time according  to
      the  licensed  number  of  users.  The unlimited license
      (with  no  limitation  on  simultaneous  use)  is   also
      available and it is equal to the licensing of 50 users.
   3) A multisystem site license is designated especially  for
      use on  computer networks  with a  dedicated server from
      which the  network users  can run  SPLOT on workstations
      and so it permits simultaneous use on one network.  Only
      one copy of the SPLOT executable file can exist in whole
      network and it must be situated on the dedicated server.
      Generally the  multisystem site  license can  be used on
      any multiuser environment  as long as  only one copy  of
      the SPLOT  executable file  exists in  that environment.
      However  note  that  this  license  cannot  be  used  on
      peer-to-peer networks (use  multi user license  for that
      purpose). You  can also  order a multisystem license for
      more sites  (servers).   The unlimited  multisystem site
      license (with no limitation to number of sites) is  also
      available and it is equal to the licensing of 20 sites.

 The  single  user  registration fee  for SPLOT for Windows is
 $65.00 (US funds).  The  multisystem  site  fee  for SPLOT is
 $140.00.

 Since  the  SPLOT  program  is  always distributed with a DLL
 library (libraries)  adapted for  a certain  plotter type, do
 not forget to mention the plotter type with which you want to
 use the  SPLOT program.   A list  of plotters  you can choose
 from is given in the  PLOTTERS.TXT file.  In this  file there
 are also given the parameters of these plotters together with
 a list of supported instructions. It makes possible to choose
 a suitable plotter  type even if  your plotter is  not listed
 (most  plotters  are  compatible  with  some plotter from the
 list). Of course, you can  order SPLOT program with more  DLL
 libraries  for  different  plotter  types.   In this case the
 single  user  registration  fee  for  any  further version is
 $20.00 and the multisystem site fee is $40.00. This principle
 is also  valid for  an upgrade.   If you  have registered  at
 least one SPLOT program version  at the full price of  $65.00
 ($140.00), now and in the  future only $20.00 ($40.00) is  to
 be paid for all other versions.

 Special offer:
 Registered users of  the MS-DOS version of  the SPLOT program
 can order the MS-Windows version for $45.00 only ( $95.00 for
 the multisystem site licence).
 In this  case fill out your  serial number  in order form and
 mark it as `upgrade from DOS version'.

 The price for multi user license is a corresponding  multiple
 of the single  user registration fee  reduced by a  graduated
 discount. The discount is  graduated according to the  number
 of users:
         Number of users  Discount [percent]
              2 - 10   20 %
             11 - 20   25 %
             21 - 30   30 %
             31 - 40   35 %
             41 - 50   40 %
 The  number  of  50  or  more  users  equals to the unlimited
 license.

 The  price  for  more  multisystem  sites  is a corresponding
 multiple of one multisystem  site license price reduced  by a
 graduated discount.  The discount  is graduated  according to
 the number of sites:
         Number of users  Discount [percent]
              2 - 10   20 %
             11 - 20   25 %
 The  number  of  20  or  more  sites  equals to the unlimited
 license.

 If you will order a multi license, you will normally  receive
 only one  master copy  of the  SPLOT files  on diskette along
 with permission  to make  its own  copies of  diskette.   The
 number of these copies is  limited by the number of  licensed
 users/sites.  If  you  want  to  receive a diskette with each
 ordered copy, you should  pay additional $1.00 per  diskette.
 The  number  of  diskettes  for  which  you  should  pay   is
 determined by the following expression:
     n = nu-1
 where nu is number of users.

 menu bar Help  item), which will  help  you  namely for multi
