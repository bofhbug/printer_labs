                   PLOTTERS.TXT

 This file  contains technical  information about  pen plotter
 types supported by the  SPLOT program. It also  contains list
 of  supported  plotter  instructions  for each listed plotter
 type.


          1. General Information:

   The  SPLOT  program  is   available  for  various   plotter
 versions.   This means  that there  are provided  DLL modules
 designated for a certain  plotter type. This principle  gives
 the maximum  reliability of  simulation of  the given plotter
 type.  At present the  DLL modules for the following  plotter
 types are at your disposal:

   An UNREGISTERED COPY  of the program  is available only  in
 the version  for the  HP-GL/2,  HP 7475A,  HP DraftMaster and
 ROLAND DXY plotters.   The versions for  other plotter  types
 can be received  only on the  basis of regular  registration.
